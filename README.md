# Robot-Vacuumer

Created 3 different Robot Vacuums for the Vacuum world and tested the best one
- Simple Random Agent
- Simple Reflex Agent
- Model-based Reflex Agent


In this assignment you will implement a simulator environment for an automatic vacuum cleaner robot, a set of different reflex-based agent programs, and perform a comparison study for cleaning a single room. Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square in the room has been cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.
